        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To die for Fettucine Alfredo. This recipe was made by Erin Marie and is a modified version of her mother's recipe. She claims her boyfriend is a connosieur of alfredo and even he can't get enough!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
